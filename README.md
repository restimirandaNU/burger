Title: EAT DA BURGER HOMEWORK

GOAL: 

The goal was to create a Burger App using Node Express Handlebars and our own ORM. It uses the MVC design pattern, Node and MySQL to query and route data to the app and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Description:

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
